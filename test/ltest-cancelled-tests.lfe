;;;; This module is meant to test the ability to recognize cancelled
;;;; tests (e.g.  fixture tests that have bad contents).
;;;;
;;;; In order to enable this test, take the number one (1) out of the behaviour
;;;; name below, and you should see "One or more tests were cancelled." in the
;;;; runner output.
;;;;
;;;; It is disabled because normally you want to see the test suite finishing
;;;; without errors.
